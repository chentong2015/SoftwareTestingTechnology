升级Junit4测试框架到Junit5，兼容两种Junit
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4-running

- Junit4 A single jar library contains the entire framework
- JUnit 5 Get more granularity and can import only what's necessary

- Only one test runner can execute tests at a time in JUnit 4
- JUnit 5 allows multiple runners to work simultaneously

- JUnit 4 never advanced beyond Java 7, missing out on a lot of features from Java 8.
- JUnit 5 makes good use of the Java 8 features.
